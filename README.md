# News Feed - Front End

This project displays news feed from a set of sources. This is a practice project to build something cool and learn a lot of stuff on the journey. Although looking elementary, the news feed project offers a lot of logical and design challenges, and is really a great project for devs of all levels to learn a lot.

This is the front-end webpack based webserver for the app. It basically serves static files required for the front-end. The overall app follows an API based design, and it's (for now atleast) a client side rendered app.

## Tech Stack

- NodeJS + NPM 6.4.0
- webpack for build
- webpack-dev-server for dev environment
- Material Design based UI using Material Design Lite
- VueJS (non-component) based development
- Works well on Chrome.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/jforcode/NewsFeedWeb.git
cd NewsFeedWeb
npm install
npm start

Open localhost:3000 to launch the app.
```

## Current Features

- Displays paginated news feed.
- Search based on title or publisher.
- Sort by publisher or published on.
- Filter by category or publisher.

## Further plans

- All major browsers' compatibility and mobile-first design.
- Front end tests.
- Integrate with main stream news apps, and show current data.
- An overall personalized app with authentication, bookmarks, favorites, notifications etc.
- Highlight broken links, fetch an image from the post to display on the app.
- Modern UI, highly responsive, custom design and branding, theme changer etc.
