# News Feed - Front End
--------------------------------

This project displays news feed from a set of sources. This is a practice project to build something cool and learn a lot of stuff on the journey. Although looking elementary, the news feed project offers a lot of logical and design challenges, and is really a great project for devs of all levels to learn a lot.

This is the front-end webpack based webserver for the app. It basically serves static files required for the front-end. The overall app follows an API based design, and it's (for now atleast) a client side rendered app.

## Tech Stack
--------------------------------

- NodeJS + NPM 6.4.0
- webpack for build
- webpack-dev-server for development
- Tested well on Chrome.

##Installation
--------------------------------

```
git clone https://github.com/jforcode/NewsFeedWeb.git
npm install
npm start

Open localhost:3000 to launch the app.
```
